> ### *LATEST PROJECT:  TEXT CLASSIFIER USING BERT TOKENIZER*

## [Classification with BERT](https://africanleo.github.io/Stock-Sentiment-using-BERT-tok-Part-2/)
### NLP Classifier with BERT-tokeniser

This NLP (natural language processing) project builds on part 1, [It's out there ! ](https://africanleo.github.io/Stock-Sentiment-Analysis/) to improve the Stock Market Sentiment text classifier by using Google's powerful open sourced BERT  algorithm.  The pre-training as well as the bidirectionality of BERT will hopefully improve results, while we keep the constraint of the limited number (+/- 6,000) of tweets in the dataset.

## [It's Out There !](https://africanleo.github.io/Stock-Sentiment-Analysis/)
### Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing

The [GameStop incident](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gamestop-reddit-explainer-what-s-happening-stock-market-n1255922) early in 2021 took the importance of  **stock market sentiment** and the role it plays in determining the price of a stock to a next level.    This project analyses tweets about stock prices and attempts to **predict the sentiment** of these tweets by employing **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.

## [Probabilities - Monty Hall Game](https://africanleo.github.io/Monty_Hall_Probabilities/)
### Brain Teaser and Probability Puzzle

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a **probability puzzle**, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal.  As a contender in a game show, should you stick to your original choice or change your door number based on the game host's suggestion?  This project delves into the statistics to determine which is your better option.
