Unemployment in South Africa has reached crisis levels and current projections show no signs of improvement.  The South African Government cites 6 reasons for the high unemployment. This notebook sets out to determines if there is data to support these theories.   

### Data Sources
In this EDA and Data Visualisation, I sourced 2 datasets from the World Bank Group (WBG) to test and evaluate each of these theories. 

#### ESG Dataset
The Sovereign Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) dataset contains 17 key sustainable measurements spanning three categories namely Environmental, Social and Governance. The World Bank Group (WBG) provides this information to investors help channel financial flows to more sustainable activities that are better aligned with the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.

#### Gross Domestic Product Dataset
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a common way to measure the size of a country's economy. GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. GDP figures in this dataset are in current U.S. dollars and spans data from 1990 to 2019.
